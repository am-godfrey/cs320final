Another Incident Type that were intreseted in analyzing was Intoxicated Driving, due to the intense cultural presence of drinking. Residents of Madison have great access to public transporation and have the easy ability to walk due to the city layout. Therefore, we would expect most people that drink at bars in Madison come from elsewhere, taking the highways.

In fact, we can see a clear pattern in the following streets: HWY 18 in the southeast, HWY 151 which is near to high concernatration of bars on State Street, HWY 113 in the north, and HWY 51, east of Lake Monona. There is distinct clustering along these roads, as most arrests occurred very close or on these streets. We recommend to ensure the safety of fellow drivers in Madison, to recommend more patrol along these routes during peak hours such as Weekends/Nights.
