The third type of incident we analyzed was theft.
We summarized the categories of theft, robbery, and theft from auto as one as they are similar crimes.
We looked at the occurence rates of these crimes and saw a steep decline in occurrences since 2009. 
Our linear regression model predicted a total of 189 incidents, an absolute minimum across all years.
The outlook of the data since April 19th, 2020 seems to be more optimistic that at this rate in 2020, we can expect 128 incidents.
Overall, the Police department does not need to focus their attention seeking these types of crimes, but they are still prevalent.

In fact, we can see below, a scatter plot of all incidents since 2014 that has regions with more occurences.
It is evident that there is a significant cluster just north of the southeast police department, and a large portion of occurrences occuring along HWY 151 into the upper east corridor.
While these occurrences have been decreasing, it is still in the public interest to patrol such areas appropriately.
