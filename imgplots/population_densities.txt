The plot above shows the population density for the year 2020 of each ward in Madison, WI. Darker shades in the plot represent a denser population. The plot shows that Madison has the higher population density around its central area, which is where the University of Wisconsin-Madison campus is located. This is not a suprise as the university brings in students from all across the state of Wisconsin, and students tend to live in apartments and dormitories rather than houses.
