In this animation, there is an evident trend that when comparing across years, the burglaries seem to happen at wider distances from one another,
speciifcally the West section of Madison in 2019. With new occurences of residential brugalries, the distance from  the police station in 2019 is on average 0.205 miles farther away from the nearest police station comapred to previous years.
As picture below, in 2020 as of April, there seems to represnet an overall trend in the west side of Madison, as burglaries happen further and more spaced out.
Therefore, in efforts to prevent burgalries in this area in specific, increased patrol might be necessary for faster travel time and to deter criminals.
