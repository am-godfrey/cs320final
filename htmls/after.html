<p>The objective of this plot is to let the viewer see the number of incidents that have been reported to the Madison Police Department in the years 2005 to 2019. The amount of reported incidents in 2005 was the lowest with 2011 and 2012 sharing the spoils for being the two years with the most reported incidents. Madison experienced an significant increase in reported incidents between 2008-2009 where it nearly increased two-fold. The Madison PD experienced high reported incidents between the years 2009 and 2012. However, after 2012, the amount of reported incidents have decreased until 2017. With a minor spike in 2018, the amount of reported incidents decreased again in 2019.  This graph is more of a foundation for other examinations of the operations of the Madison PD as we can use this to focus on certain years of interest.</p>
