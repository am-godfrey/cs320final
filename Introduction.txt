Introduction:

We are looking at the city of maidson Data about police incidents and arrets from data released
to better advise the police where to enfore there efforts.

Our anlysis focuses on what the police can do differnet, and show the trends of aspects of crime and how they can adjust.

Before we start to look at our findings, it is important to note out limiations in the study

1. First, the data released was determined with the following criteria:
"""Incidents listed are selected by the Officer In Charge of each shift that may have significant public interest. 
Incidents listed are not inclusive of all incidents."""

Therefore, the data may not be an all inclsuive list of where the majority of crime is occuring.
But, it can allow us to make infromed conclusion with the idea that it is a sampling.

Our data is at the will of the city's willignness, accuracy, and consitency to use this system for the public to see.

2. In our anlysis the city seems to not fully utilize the reporting system until 2005, and rampant use starting in 2009,
so most of our analysis accounted for that.

3. The Geogrphic location we estaimted through Google's Geocoding API and the Officers ability to report a descpritive address
leaves 44 of our incidents incorrect, 0.2% of data out of ~13,000 Incidents. Roughly 24 incidents were not in madison when estimating their position, 
and the other 20 were slightly outside the city of Madison limits. Additionally, when estimating such addresses, the police's ability
to label the location affects the exact location difference, if given a street name without a number. Overall, the police did a well enough
job at reporting the locations to leave us in good faith the locations are accurate
